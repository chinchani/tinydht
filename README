TinyDHT is a light-weight implementation of the Azureus Kademlia DHT.

The main goal of TinyDHT is to provide a generic Internet-wide publish/retrieve capability of
key/value pairs.

NOTE: No longer under active development.

Lessons learnt:
==============
1) Latency is very high
2) As a client participating in a distributed protocol, 
cannot really play any tricks to "speed" things up because the network will punish you!
3) The amount of information that can be stored as key/value is very limited 
because Kademlia was designed primarily for routing and not storage.
